# Openai Telegram Bot

Telegram chatbot built using Nodejs and hosted as Netlify serverless function. This chatbot uses OpenAI api to send reply to users on Telegram.

> Currently I've restricted this bot to only reply to messages in a private group created by me. OpenAI api counts token for every response and I've to pay the bill, that's why I configured the bot to not respond to public messages. But this code is public and anyone can fork this repo.
